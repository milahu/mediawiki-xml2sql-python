> i need an XML parser that can parse an infinite stream of documents, so is a hybrid between XML stream parser and XML document parser.

If you need to parse an infinite stream of XML documents, you can consider using a hybrid approach that combines elements of both streaming XML parsers and document parsers. One library that supports this hybrid approach is lxml in Python.

lxml is a feature-rich library that provides a streaming API called iterparse() along with a DOM-based API for parsing XML. This allows you to parse XML documents incrementally while still having access to the advantages of a document-oriented parser.

Here's an example of how you can use lxml to parse an infinite stream of XML documents:

...

In this example, the parse_xml_stream() function uses etree.iterparse() to iterate over the XML stream and process the document elements as they are encountered. The process_document() function demonstrates how you can handle the completed XML document element.

By using iterparse(), the XML documents are parsed incrementally, and the processed elements are cleared from memory to prevent excessive memory usage. This allows you to handle an infinite stream of XML documents without loading the entire stream into memory at once.

Note that the specific implementation may vary depending on your requirements and the characteristics of the XML stream you're working with.

"""

from lxml import etree

def parse_xml_stream(xml_stream):
    parser = etree.iterparse(xml_stream, events=('start', 'end'), remove_blank_text=True)

    for event, element in parser:
        if event == 'end' and element.tag == 'document':
            # Process the completed document here
            process_document(element)

            # Clear the processed elements to free memory
            element.clear()

            # Free the processed elements from memory
            while element.getprevious() is not None:
                del element.getparent()[0]

def process_document(document_element):
    # Process the XML document element here
    print(document_element.tag)

# Example usage
xml_stream = get_infinite_xml_stream()  # Replace with your method of obtaining the XML stream
parse_xml_stream(xml_stream)
